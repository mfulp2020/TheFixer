# How to Fix iPhone Error 4013

If you are seeing **Error 4013** while trying to restore or update your iPhone, it usually means there is a communication breakdown between your device and your computer. This is often caused by a faulty cable, a bad USB port, or outdated software.

## Quick Checks
Before diving into the complex fixes, try these simple steps:
1.  **Change the USB Cable:** Use an official Apple Lightning/USB-C cable.
2.  **Switch USB Ports:** Plug directly into the computer, not a hub.
3.  **Update iTunes/Finder:** Ensure your Mac or PC software is on the latest version.

## Method 1: Force Restart
Often, a simple force restart can clear the glitch preventing the restore.
*   **iPhone 8 and later:** Press Vol Up, then Vol Down, then hold the Side Button until the Apple logo appears.
*   **iPhone 7:** Hold Vol Down + Side Button.

## Method 2: Recovery Mode
1.  Connect your iPhone to the computer.
2.  Perform the Force Restart steps (above) but **keep holding** even after the Apple logo appears, until you see the "Connect to Computer" screen.
3.  Choose **Update** (not Restore) to try and save your data.

## Method 3: DFU Mode (Last Resort)
If Recovery Mode fails, Device Firmware Update (DFU) mode bypasses the bootloader.
1.  Connect to computer.
2.  Look up the specific DFU key combination for your model (it varies).
3.  Restore the device. **Warning:** This will erase all data.

## Conclusion
Error 4013 is annoying, but usually hardware-related (cable/port). If none of the above work, it might be a hardware failure on the motherboard (NAND chip), requiring professional repair.
