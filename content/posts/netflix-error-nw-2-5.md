# How to Fix Netflix Code NW-2-5

The error **NW-2-5** is a network connectivity error. It means your smart TV, console, or streaming stick cannot reach Netflix servers.

## Immediate Fixes
1.  **Restart Home Network:** Unplug your modem and router for 30 seconds. Plug them back in.
2.  **Check Signal Strength:** If you are on Wi-Fi, is the TV too far from the router?
3.  **Bypass Router:** If possible, plug an Ethernet cable directly into the device to rule out Wi-Fi interference.

## DNS Settings (Gaming Consoles)
If you are on Xbox or PlayStation, your DNS might be blocked.
1.  Go to Network Settings.
2.  Set DNS to Automatic.
3.  OR try Google DNS: Primary `8.8.8.8`, Secondary `8.8.4.4`.

## Carrier Block?
If you are using a hotel Wi-Fi, school network, or mobile hotspot, streaming services are often blocked by the admin. Try a VPN or a different network to confirm.
