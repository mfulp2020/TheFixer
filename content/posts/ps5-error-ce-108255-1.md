# PS5 Error CE-108255-1 Explained

This is the generic "Application Error" code on PlayStation 5. It means the game crashed. If it happens once, it's a glitch. If it happens every time you launch a specific game, there is a problem.

## Fix 1: Update Everything
1.  **System:** Settings > System > System Software > Update.
2.  **Game:** Highlight the game icon, press Options > Check for Update.

## Fix 2: Rebuild Database (Safe Mode)
This does **not** delete your games. It just cleans up the file system.
1.  Turn off PS5 completely.
2.  Hold the Power button for 7 seconds (until the second beep).
3.  Connect controller via USB.
4.  Select option **5. Clear Cache and Rebuild Database**.
5.  Choose **Rebuild Database**.

## Fix 3: Disable HDCP
Some users report conflicts with capture cards or TVs.
*   Settings > System > HDMI > **Disable Enable HDCP**.

## Fix 4: Reinstall
Delete the game and redownload it. If the error persists across *multiple* games, contact PlayStation Support—your GPU might be failing.
