# Discord Mic Not Working: The Ultimate Guide

It’s the classic gamer problem. You join the call, the green ring doesn't light up.

## Fix 1: Check Input Device
1.  Go to **User Settings** (Cog icon) > **Voice & Video**.
2.  Under **Input Device**, make sure your actual microphone is selected (not "Default").
3.  Do a **Mic Test**.

## Fix 2: Reset Voice Settings
If you messed with noise suppression or sensitivity:
1.  Scroll to the bottom of the Voice & Video page.
2.  Click **Reset Voice Settings**.

## Fix 3: Allow Access (Windows Privacy)
Windows might be blocking Discord from using the mic.
1.  Type "Microphone Privacy Settings" in Windows Search.
2.  Ensure **"Allow desktop apps to access your microphone"** is ON.
3.  Check if Discord is in the list.

## Fix 4: Run as Admin
Sometimes Discord needs admin rights to capture audio (especially if you use Push to Talk). Right-click Discord -> **Run as Administrator**.
