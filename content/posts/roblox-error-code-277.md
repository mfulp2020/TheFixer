# How to Fix Roblox Error Code 277

**Error Code 277** in Roblox is a "General Connection Error." It means your device cannot communicate with the Roblox game server. It’s infamous for happening on tablets and mobile, but PC users get it too.

## Why is this happening?
*   Weak Wi-Fi signal.
*   Corrupted cache files on your device.
*   Roblox servers are down.

## Fix 1: Clear Roblox Cache (PC)
1.  Press `Win + R` and type `%localappdata%\Roblox\Logs`.
2.  Delete all files in the folder.
3.  Go back to the Roblox folder and delete the content of `Versions`.
4.  Restart Roblox.

## Fix 2: Switch Networks
If you are on Wi-Fi, try switching to **Mobile Data** (or vice versa) to see if it's your router blocking the port.

## Fix 3: The "Airplane Mode" Trick (Mobile)
1.  Close Roblox.
2.  Turn on **Airplane Mode**.
3.  Wait 10 seconds.
4.  Turn off Airplane Mode and reconnect to Wi-Fi.
5.  Launch Roblox.

## Fix 4: Reinstall
Roblox updates frequently. Sometimes a clean install is the only way to clear corrupted assets causing the disconnect.

## Summary
Error 277 is almost always a local network glitch. Resetting your connection or cache usually solves it!
